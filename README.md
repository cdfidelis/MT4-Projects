MetaTrader MQL4 Forex Trading Robots

Some MT4 Projects I have worked on and some I'm still working on 

Hi guys checkout my new robots,  

Name: H4 ENGULF STRATEGY;
Currency Pair: EURUSD only;
Timeframe: H4
Year: 2017-present
-Over 400% in just 4years 
-Less than 18% drawdown 
-Its based on a candlestick pattern and moving average


Name: FWD ENGULF MORNING STAR STRATEGY;
Currency Pair: EURUSD only; 
Timeframe: H1
Year: 2017-2018
-Over 400% in just 2years 
-Less than 18% drawdown -Its based on candlestick patterns, engulf and vibration studies 
-Takeprofit: 450pts -Stoploss:varies; min:400pts max:700pts. 
The large sl is due to manipulation I think it has potential. 


Name: Average Burst;
Currency Pair: EURUSD only; 
Timeframe: H4
Year: 2013-present
-Over 400% in just 8years 
-Its based on off a strategy that models price movements as though they happen only in bursts hereby removing 
unwanted noise(volatilty) and making the market look like it has only two places price can go, up or dowm.


If you have any ideas or functions (reversal detector, trend detector etc) that can improve it's profitability do share. 

Look at images in the project for more details 

Note: Set your MT4 with the right parameters and timeframe else you wouldn't see the same result
